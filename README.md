# Operation-Analytics-and-Investigating-Metric-Spike

Project Description

The project aims to analyze and derive insights from these tables by performing various
calculations and metrics.
The provided queries in the case study involve tasks such as calculating user engagement,
user growth, weekly retention, weekly engagement per device, and email engagement
metrics.
By running these queries on the respective tables, we can obtain valuable information about
user activity, product usage, user retention, and engagement patterns.

Approach

Through my comprehensive approach, I was able to unlock valuable insights that shed
light on user preferences, the growth trajectory of our product, and the effectiveness of
our email engagement strategies.
These findings serve as a solid foundation for further analysis and decision-making,
enabling us to optimize our product offerings, enhance user experiences, and maximize
the impact of our email communications.
Tech-Stack Used
The initial phase of the project presented challenges regarding the import of the provided
CSV files into a suitable database management system such as MySQL or MS SQL.
Extensive research was conducted to determine the most effective method for importing
the CSV files into MS SQL. It was crucial to ensure that the data from the CSV files was
accurately transferred and aligned with the appropriate database schema.
After thorough investigation, the optimal solution was found by utilizing the Task option
with Flat File import functionality within MS SQL. This method facilitated the seamless
importation of the CSV files into MS SQL, enabling the creation of the necessary tables
to store the data. By following this approach, the project successfully established a solid
foundation for subsequent data analysis.

Insights

Here are the 5 Major insights I was able to uncover from this project.

1. User Engagement: By analyzing user engagement metrics, we observed patterns
indicating the level of activeness and quality perception among users. This insight
helps identify segments of highly engaged users, enabling targeted strategies to
enhance overall user experience and drive product adoption.

2. User Growth: The analysis of user growth over time revealed the trajectory and
pace of user acquisition. This knowledge allows us to assess the effectiveness of our
growth strategies and make informed decisions on resource allocation and
expansion plans.

3. Weekly Retention: The weekly retention analysis provided insights into the
percentage of users retained after signing up for our product. By understanding the
retention rate, we can refine our onboarding process, optimize user engagement
initiatives, and improve long-term user retention.

4. Weekly Engagement per Device: Analyzing user engagement on different devices
helped identify device preferences and usage patterns. This insight can guide
product development decisions, such as optimizing user interfaces and functionalities
for specific devices, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.

5. Email Engagement Metrics: By examining email engagement metrics, such as the
number of users engaging with email content, we gained insights into the
effectiveness of our email communication strategies. This information can be used to
tailor email campaigns, improve open and click-through rates, and optimize user
engagement with our email services.

Overall, these insights empower us to make data-driven decisions, optimize our product
offerings, and improve user experiences.
